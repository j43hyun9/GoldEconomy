# GoldEconomy

  ## For Developers:
  Please see the [VaultAPI](https://github.com/MilkBowl/VaultAPI) page for information on developing with Vault's API. In the past, you would use the same artifact as servers installed, but the API has now been split from the main project and is under a different artifact name. Please make sure you           accommodate this change in your build process.


  ## Why GoldEconomy?:
  The economy plugins out there are very well done, but they don't have the features I need, so I created one.


  ## License:
  Those who need it can just write it.
